    <h1>My Favourite Hobby space 
   </h1>
    
    <div> My hobby is exploring space since I was in Kindy, and I always wanted to be astronaut or a scientist and fly away to Mars to start new Colony.<br>
My mum says if you study hard, you can go to science school full of science and Maths and you can make your own Rocket.<br>
I am learning Coding and I already posted a website so now I am a declared coder and I can create any website and I am creating Space website I named it NASO.<br>
